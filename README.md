Vult is a simple and powerful language to program high-performance algorithms that may run in small microprocessors or microcontrollers. Vult is specially useful when programming Digital Signal Processing (DSP) algorithms like audio effects or synthesizers.

The Vult compiler is a transcompiler, which takes Vult code and produces plain C/C++ code that can be compiled in any platform with a C/C++ compiler, for example: Arduino or Teensy boards. Vult can also generate JavaScript that can be run directly in the browser or C/C++ that can be compiled as Pure Data externals. Code written in Vult has freedom.

Check out the documentation and tutorial in http://modlfo.github.io/vult/ or take a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/modlfo/vult/wiki).

### Basics

To generate C/C++ code with floating point arithmetic you have to execute vult as follows:

```
$ vultc -ccode infile.vult -o outfile
```

This will produce the files `outfile.h` and `outfile.cpp`. In order to compile and link these files you need to include in your project the files `runtime/vultin.h` and `runtime/vultin.cpp`.

To generate code with fixed point arithmetics you need to execute:
```
$ vultc -ccode -real fixed infile.vult -o outfile
```

Fixed point arithmetics are performed in q16 format; 16 bits for the integer part and 16 for the decimal.

Vult provides a few templates; for example to generate objects compatible with the Teensy Audio Library or Pure Data externals.

## Installing

There are three flavors the Vult compiler:
- command line ([native executables](https://github.com/modlfo/vult/releases) and [node.js version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vult))
- [node.js library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vultlib)
- [web browser library](https://github.com/modlfo/vult/releases)

### Installing with npm

You need to have `node.js` and `npm` installed.

```
$ npm install vult -g
```

This will install provide `vultc` command in your path. Vult is updated frequently, you can use the same command to update Vult.

The native executables can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/modlfo/vult/releases).

To install the node.js library use:
```
$ npm install vultlib
```

### Embedding in a Web page

The compiler can be embedded in a web page providing and it provides all the functionality.
```
<script src="https://modlfo.github.io/vult/javascripts/vultweb.js"></script>
```

For an example check:

https://github.com/modlfo/vult-webaudio

## Text editor support

### SublimeText

Put the [syntax file](https://github.com/modlfo/vult/raw/master/other/SublimeTextSyntax/vult.sublime-syntax) in the corresponding Sublime Text `User` packages.

In Mac, the path is the following `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/vult.sublime-syntax`.

### Visual Studio Code

Install the extension `vult` available in the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=modlfo.vult).

## Compile from source

### Requirements

- Ocaml >= 4.03
- Opam >= 1.2    https://opam.ocaml.org/

### Installing the tools
 The simplest way to install the requirements is with Opam
```
$ opam switch 4.07.1
$ opam install ocamlbuild containers ppx_deriving pla result ounit js_of_ocaml js_of_ocaml-ppx
```
### Compiling Vult

To compile the native executable:
```
$ make
```

Compile the node.js code:
```
$ make jscompiler
```

Running tests (Linux and macOS):
```
$ make test
```
